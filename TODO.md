# TODO
1. Settle on final project vision
  - Name?
  - Features?
  - General user flow?
2. Plan out frontend
  - How to map out campus?
  - Best data viz technique?
  - Best visualization tools?
  - Input screen and data viz dashboard UI
3. Plan out backend
  - Create API endpoints
4. Plan out server
  - Best easy-to-setup database?
  - Maybe use a *graph database* (GraphDB, Neo4j?)
5. Decide on presentation logic
  - Probably run everything on localhost to avoid deployment?

# Consider

# Technologies
