# TODO
1. Settle on final project vision
2. Plan out frontend
  - How to map out campus?
  - Best visualization tools?
3. Plan out backend
  - Create API endpoints
4. Plan out server
  - Best easy-to-setup database?
  - Maybe use a *graph database* (GraphDB, Neo4j?)
5. Decide on presentation logic
  - Probably run everything on localhost to avoid deployment?

# Consider
- What APIs can we use?
- Fit to specific sponsor challenges (IBM?)

# Description
Campus volunteer-based contract-tracing and building density monitoring.

# Technologies
Frontend
React
*Visualization stuff*
D3, pure JavaScript, Google Maps API?

Backend
Python (Flask) or Express (NodeJS)?
